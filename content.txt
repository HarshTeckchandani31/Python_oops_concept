1. class and Obj(example)
2. class hass data/attribute and func/methods
    >code walkthrough
    >attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. why python is called oop? everything in python is an object(data structure, data type etc)
4. advantages of OOPS:
    > you can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging 
    > easy to colab


5. End to End project (chatbook class)
    > func vs method
    > magic method / constructor/ durder method
    > self
    > you can also create attribute outside the class

    > Encalpsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method

6. Inheritance
    > Inheritance code sample
    > Why Inheritance is needed? {code reusability, parent has no access to child class}
    > Why gets inherited? - constructor, non private attributes, non private methods
    > constructor overloading and method overloading
    > super keyword(can be used only inside class, can not access variables/ attributes, used inside child class)

    > Types of inheritance - 1. single inheritance | 2. Multilevel | 3. Hierarchical | 4. Multiple <diamond Problem> | 5. Hybrid
